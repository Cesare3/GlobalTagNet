motion
behaviors
of
a
rigid
body
can
be
characterized
by
a
6
dimensional
motion
trajectory
,
which
contains
position
vectors
of
a
reference
point
on
the
rigid
body
and
rotations
of
this
rigid
body
over
time
this
paper
devises
a
rotation
and
relative
velocity
\(
rrv
\)
descriptor
by
exploring
the
local
translational
and
rotational
invariants
of
motion
trajectories
of
rigid
bodies
,
which
is
insensitive
to
noise
,
invariant
to
rigid
transformation
and
scaling
a
flexible
metric
is
also
introduced
to
measure
the
distance
between
two
rrv
descriptors
the
rrv
descriptor
is
then
applied
to
characterize
motions
of
a
human
body
skeleton
modeled
as
articulated
interconnections
of
multiple
rigid
bodies
to
illustrate
the
descriptive
ability
of
the
rrv
descriptor
,
we
explore
it
for
different
rigid
body
motion
recognition
tasks
the
experimental
results
on
benchmark
datasets
demonstrate
that
this
simple
rrv
descriptor
outperforms
the
previous
ones
regarding
recognition
accuracy
without
increasing
computational
cost
